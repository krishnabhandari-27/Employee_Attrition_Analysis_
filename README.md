# Employee Attrition Analysis

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project analyzes **employee attrition** using both **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python** and an **interactive dashboard in Power BI**.  
The goal is to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and provide insights that can help HR make better decisions to improve retention.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** â€“ Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Power BI Desktop** â€“ Interactive dashboards & KPIs  
- **Excel/CSV Dataset** â€“ Employee attrition data  
- **DAX** â€“ For calculated measures  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow
1. **EDA (Python - Jupyter Notebook):**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
   - Checked for null/missing values  
   - Univariate & bivariate analysis (histograms, countplots, boxplots)  
   - Identified correlations between features (heatmap)  
   - Key Insights:
     - Employees with lower satisfaction are more likely to leave  
     - High working hours increase attrition risk  
     - Most attrition happens in employees with fewer years at the company  

2. **Dashboard (Power BI):**
   - **KPIs (Cards):**
     - Total Employees  
     - Total Attrition  
     - Attrition Rate (%)  
     - Average Monthly Hours  
   - **Charts/Visuals:**
     - Bar Charts â€“ Attrition by Department/Role  
     - Histogram â€“ Satisfaction level distribution  
     - Line Chart â€“ Average monthly hours vs. years at company  
     - Pie Chart â€“ Attrition distribution across departments  
   - **Insights:**
     - Sales & HR departments have the highest attrition rates  
     - Overworked employees tend to leave more  
     - Clear link between job satisfaction and attrition

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Impact
- Helps HR identify high-risk departments and roles  
- Provides data-driven insights to improve employee satisfaction  
- Supports policy decisions to reduce attrition and save hiring costs
